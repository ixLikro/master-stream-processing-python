# Master - Stream Processing
## Processing Part 

This project processes data that was generated by the [Java-Simulation](https://github.com/ixLikro/master-stream-processing-simulation-java). <br>
The [Simulation-Part]((https://github.com/ixLikro/master-stream-processing-simulation-java)) simulates a a detached house with an off-grind photovoltaic system.

Every simulated Sensor has its own socket connection and sends its data via a JSON string.

The goal of this project was to get in touch with stream processing.
To achieve this goal we use the python library [streamz](https://github.com/python-streamz/streamz). <br>

Some of the incoming data get just displayed at the dashboard.<br>
In these cases the processing part is simple:
- extract the important Data from the JSON
- make a validation check
- and as sink a updateDataOnDashboard - Function

<br>
But some other output is more complex here is an example of the weather forecast calculation as flow chart:



### Output
This project output the following Data:

- Simulation Time
- Outside temperature
- The average of the 3 barometric pressure
- weather forecast (calculated of the barometer and temperature values)


- current energy consumption
- current produced energy by the photovoltaic system
- battery state in %
- the yesterday energy cost
- the energy cost of the last month
- energy available warning (if the battery is full and the seems to getting worse) 


- For 4 rooms the following:
    - Air quality (CO2 portion in ppm)
    - window state
    - open warning (if air quality is bad)
    - close warning (if the air quality is good and it is cold outside)
